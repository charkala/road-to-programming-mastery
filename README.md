# Road to Web Development

Learn the fundamentals of modern web development with this simple collection of lessons and resources. These courses and materials should provide the basics of modern web development and guide you to further improve on your future endaevors.

## Prospectus

The program will guide you through the following sets of the different stages of development:

1. Environment
2. Version Control
3. Introduction to Coding
4. Web Fundamentals
5. Full Stack Development
6. Frameworks

Moving forward, the courses should help you get started and I'm sure you'll learn enough to reach the modern web development standard. It's fast and ever moving, make sure to keep yourself up-to-date!

## Environment

This includes the commonly known `terminal` or `shell` commands.

One of the most important part of development is learning to understand how programs "communicate" with the machine you are writing code on.

Modern programming is "modular" - applications can "install/attach" external modules (such as extensions/libraries) and many use the terminal to add such modules.
